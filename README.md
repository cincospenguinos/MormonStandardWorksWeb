# MormonStandardWorksWeb

The website component of the Mormon Standard Works project I'm working on.

## Ideas

- [ ] Have two books to select and compare
- [ ] Link to Wikipedia using the [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)

## TODO

- [ ] Style the selectors in a nice looking way
- [ ] Add axis information to the TextualSimilarityOverview
- [ ] Add labels to the axes of the TextualSimilarityOverview
- [ ] Get report on where textual similarity occurs in the two texts
- [ ] Show "where similarities occur" report on hover over bars

## Notes

* Keep a link to [this comparison to *The Late War*](http://wordtree.org/thelatewar/)
