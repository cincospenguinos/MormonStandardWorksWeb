## What is this?

This is a visualization that explores the similarity between the religious texts of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (often referred to as Mormons) and other works of literature
relevant to its founder, Joseph Smith.

## Why is this significant?

A variety of people have pointed out how *The Book of Mormon* contains a variety of anachronisms,
making it read more like a work of fiction from 19th century America and less like a literal
translation of an ancient text. This website seeks to explore some of the parallels between the
sacred texts of Mormonism and the various writings that Joseph Smith was likely aware of or had read.

## Where is this data coming from?

I collected the various books from a few different places, and then ran it through a program I wrote
to extract the words from each of the books as unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etcetera, and had that
program output that information in the form necessary for this website. You can look at the code
that generates that output [here](https://github.com/cincospenguinos/MormonStandardWorks).

You can also look at the code for this website [here](https://github.com/cincospenguinos/MormonStandardWorksWeb).

## Why are you doing this?

I saw [this page](http://wordtree.org/thelatewar/) through [the CES Letter](https://cesletter.org/) and thought that 
the connections between *The Late War* and *The Book of Mormon* would be something interesting to explore in detail.
I sought to replicate their experiments with the texts they pulled together, as well as a few others that I thought
would be significant as well.

## Where can I learn more about these connections?

## Are you anti-mormon?

No.
